# K-MEANS-ALGORITHM
There are many models for **clustering** 


There are many models for **clustering** out there. In this notebook, we will be presenting the model that is considered one of the simplest models amongst them. Despite its simplicity, the **K-means** is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from **unlabeled data**. In this notebook, you will learn how to use k-Means for customer segmentation.

Some real-world applications of k-means:
- Customer segmentation
- Understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish
- Pattern recognition
- Machine learning
- Data compression


In this notebook we practice k-means clustering with 2 examples:
- k-means on a random generated dataset
- Using k-means for customer segmentation



Next we will be making <i> random clusters </i> of points by using the <b> make_blobs </b> class. The <b> make_blobs </b> class can take in many inputs, but we will be using these specific ones. <br> <br>
<b> <u> Input </u> </b>
<ul>
    <li> <b>n_samples</b>: The total number of points equally divided among clusters. </li>
    <ul> <li> Value will be: 5000 </li> </ul>
    <li> <b>centers</b>: The number of centers to generate, or the fixed center locations. </li>
    <ul> <li> Value will be: [[4, 4], [-2, -1], [2, -3],[1,1]] </li> </ul>
    <li> <b>cluster_std</b>: The standard deviation of the clusters. </li>
    <ul> <li> Value will be: 0.9 </li> </ul>
</ul>
<br>
<b> <u> Output </u> </b>
<ul>
    <li> <b>X</b>: Array of shape [n_samples, n_features]. (Feature Matrix)</li>
    <ul> <li> The generated samples. </li> </ul> 
    <li> <b>y</b>: Array of shape [n_samples]. (Response Vector)</li>
    <ul> <li> The integer labels for cluster membership of each sample. </li> </ul>
</ul>



The KMeans class has many parameters that can be used, but we will be using these three:
<ul>
    <li> <b>init</b>: Initialization method of the centroids. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> Value will be: "k-means++" </li>
        <li> k-means++: Selects initial cluster centers for k-mean clustering in a smart way to speed up convergence.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> <b>n_clusters</b>: The number of clusters to form as well as the number of centroids to generate. </li>
    <ul> <li> Value will be: 4 (since we have 4 centers)</li> </ul>
    <li> <b>n_init</b>: Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of n_init consecutive runs in terms of inertia. </li>
    <ul> <li> Value will be: 12 </li> </ul>
</ul>

Initialize KMeans with these parameters, where the output parameter is called <b>k_means</b>.
